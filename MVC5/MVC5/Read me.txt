To be able to run this from code you will need to create the database yourself using the IdentityDb.sql which
you can find along side the sln file.

The script will not only create the db but will populate it with 2 users, one an admin the other a standard user.

The user details are:

Name				Password
admin@test.com		Testing1?
bob@test.com		Testing1?
